            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            Hello! I'm Obinna Bestman, a Web Developer currently living in Rivers, Nigeria. 
            Iâ€™m passionate about creating products and experiences that consider human nature, 
            empower people to lead rewarding lives, and foster healthy communities.

            <h2>How I began</h2>
            My path into Web Development began with the realisation of how technology can literally shape a life, 
            a community and a society. Being Nigerian, I learned the importance technology in our daily lives, 
            and how technology improves a person's quality of life. I have always had a love for psychology and my fascination with the way people think, feel, 
            and behave has led me to think about how technological products could help people and communities reinvent and live more fulfilling lives.

            <h2>What drives me</h2>
            Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated and frustrated by questions. 
            These days, some of the questions that get me thinking are: What does a future without geographical barriers look like? 
            How does constantly evolving technology exclude or empower people? How are we building for our 80-year-old selves?

            <h2>What I like</h2>
            My love for creation manifests itself not only in technological products, but also in drawing, photography, and music. <br> <br>
            During my free time, I enjoy reading, and taking a journey down an internet rabbit hole trying to figure out why certain things are the way they are. <br> <br>
            I listen to an unhealthy amount of inspirational musics, and I enjoy perspectives from some big tech companies like META, Tesla, Google and more.  
            Currently, I am curious about how the Blockchain impacts our future, and I revel in the simplicity of children's books.
